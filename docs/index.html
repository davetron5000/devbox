      <p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
        100 pages, 15 chapters.  Here they are:
      </p>
      <ol class="w-100 measure mh-auto">
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Your Dev Environment Sucks</strong>. What problem are we solving? You can feel it in your bones.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>A Dev Environment Defined</strong>.  There's some VC that thinks dev experience is making a better version of New Relic and that's <strong>not</strong> what's happening. Dev environment is where you write your code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>The Four Types of Dev Environments</strong>.  Includes a Gartner quadrant to prove, without a doubt, that this book will help you build the best dev environment. The other three types are terrible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>What is Docker and How Does It Work?</strong>. This chapter is worth the price alone, because it provides a Docker-to-English dictionary!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Managing the Operating System With Base Images</strong>. Learn the convoluted process by which you try to determine if your operating system vendor wants you downloading images from the Internet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Installing Software in the Dev Environment</strong>. Aaaaaand, this is where I explain—or at least try to—how to safely trust piping curl into bash for the purposes of installing software on a Linux box.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Publishing Ports and Mounting Volumes to Do Development</strong>. Seems simply enough to connect your Docker stuff to the outside world, but it's not.  At least not until you read this chapter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Running Databases and Caches with One Line of Code</strong>. Say good bye to figuring out why some old version of Postgres no longer works on MacOs Bakersfield (or whatever).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>What is a Good User Experience for Automation Scripts?</strong>. Before this chapter, you will have learned how awesome Docker actually us, but the command line part will still suck. <strong>After</strong> this chapter, you will know what proper command line developer experience is.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>The Arcane World of the UNIX Command Line</strong>. In which I explain exit codes, output streams, variable expansion, and quotation marks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Writing One Nice Script</strong>. The most bash code you will ever read in a book that isn't about bash.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Build the Remaining Scripts</strong>. Did you know you can apply normal software engineering principles to bash scripts? You will after this chapter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Sustainably Maintaining The Dev Environment</strong>. Yes, you can set it up, but you also need to keep it going.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>There’s No Such Thing as a Free Lunch</strong>. Nothing is easy in this world.  This part includes an entire section on how strange or weird Microsoft's Dev Containers thing is.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Colophon or, The Chapter About Fonts</strong>. Everyone loves fonts.
