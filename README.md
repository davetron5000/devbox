# devbox.computer

This holds the https://devbox.computer website source code, which is the site for the book "Sustainable Dev Environments with
Docker and Bash".

There is also code here to create such an environment, though it is not 100% consistent with the book.  The code here is a work
in progress, intended to allow piecing together a dev environment more easily.
